# TypeForge Upgrade Navigation Fix - Implementation Complete ✅

## 🎯 **Issue Identified and Resolved**

### **Root Cause:**
The upgrade/unlock buttons weren't working because **guest users (non-authenticated users) were being treated as `null` users**, which caused the PremiumGuard and PremiumFeatureCard components to show "Sign In to Continue" prompts instead of upgrade prompts that navigate to the pricing page.

### **Core Problem:**
- **Guest users** had `user = null` in AuthContext
- **PremiumGuard** showed sign-in prompts instead of upgrade prompts for `null` users
- **PremiumFeatureCard** didn't render lock overlays for `null` users
- **No upgrade buttons were clickable** for non-authenticated users

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Updated AuthContext (`context/AuthContext.tsx`)**
```typescript
// Before: Non-authenticated users got user = null
} else {
  setUser(null);
}

// After: Non-authenticated users get guest user with free tier
} else {
  setUser({
    uid: 'guest',
    name: null,
    email: null,
    subscription: {
      tier: 'free',
      // ... free tier configuration
    },
    features: {
      // ... limited free features
    }
  });
}
```

**Impact:** Guest users now have proper user state with "free" tier, enabling premium feature detection.

### **2. Updated PremiumGuard (`components/PremiumGuard.tsx`)**
```typescript
// Before: Showed sign-in prompt for null users
if (!user) {
  return <SignInPrompt />;
}

// After: Shows upgrade prompts for guest and null users
if (!user || user.uid === 'guest') {
  // Show premium upgrade overlay with unlock buttons
  return <PremiumUpgradeOverlay />;
}
```

**Impact:** Guest users now see proper "Unlock" buttons that navigate to pricing page.

### **3. Updated PremiumFeatureCard (`components/PremiumFeatureCard.tsx`)**
```typescript
// Before: No access check for null users
const hasAccess = () => {
  if (!user) return false;
  // ...
};

// After: Proper access check for guest users
const hasAccess = () => {
  if (!user || user.uid === 'guest') return false;
  // ...
};
```

**Impact:** Guest users now see premium lock overlays with clickable upgrade buttons.
