- **Changes**:
  - Added conditional rendering to show user profile when authenticated
  - Displays user avatar (gradient circle with user icon) and name/email
  - Added profile/settings button with gear icon
  - Enhanced both desktop and mobile menu layouts
  - Maintains sign-in/sign-up buttons for non-authenticated users

### 2. Profile Component Enhancements

  - Imported and used PremiumBadge component
  - Enhanced layout with user avatar and premium badge display

  - Improved visual design with better spacing and typography

### 3. App Component Updates
- **File**: `App.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added sign-out detection and automatic redirect to landing page
  - Ensures users who sign out from the app view return to landing page
  - Maintains existing sign-in redirect functionality

## User Experience Flow

### Before Authentication
- **Landing Page Header**: Shows "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons
- **Mobile Menu**: Shows sign-in and sign-up options

### After Successful Sign-In/Sign-Up
- **Desktop Header**: 
  - Replaces auth buttons with user profile section
  - Shows circular avatar with user icon
  - Displays user name (or email username if no name)
  - Includes settings/profile access button
- **Mobile Menu**:
  - Shows larger user profile card
  - Displays user avatar and name
  - Provides "Profile & Settings" button access

### Profile Modal Features
- **User Avatar**: Gradient circle with user icon
- **User Information**: Name, email, subscription tier with premium badge
- **Subscription Details**: Current tier and expiration date (if applicable)
- **Member Since**: Account creation date
- **Sign Out**: Red button to sign out and return to landing page

## Visual Design Elements

### User Avatar
- Gradient background using accent colors (`from-accent to-accent/80`)
- Circular design with user silhouette icon
- Consistent sizing: 32px (desktop), 40px (mobile), 64px (profile modal)

### Profile Container
- Semi-transparent background with backdrop blur effect
- Border with subtle white/20 opacity
- Responsive spacing and typography
- Smooth hover animations

### Premium Integration
- Uses existing PremiumBadge component
- Shows subscription tier with appropriate styling
- Displays subscription end date when applicable

## Responsive Design
- **Desktop (md+)**: Horizontal layout with avatar and name inline
- **Mobile**: Vertical layout with larger elements for touch interaction
- **Profile Modal**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication State Detection
```javascript
user && user.uid !== 'guest'
```
- Checks for authenticated user (not guest/anonymous)
- Handles loading states with skeleton placeholders

### User Display Logic
```javascript
user.name || user.email?.split('@')[0] || 'User'
```
- Prioritizes display name, falls back to email username, defaults to "User"

### Navigation Integration
- Profile button opens existing profile modal
- Sign-out triggers return to landing page when in app view
- Maintains all existing modal functionality

## Security Considerations
- No sensitive data exposed in header display
- Uses existing authentication context and security measures
- Proper state cleanup on sign-out
- Session management through existing secure storage

## Accessibility Features
- Screen reader friendly with semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation support through existing focus styles
- High contrast elements with accessible color combinations
- Tooltip support for profile button ("View Profile")

## Browser Compatibility
- Uses standard CSS and SVG icons (no external dependencies)
- Gradient backgrounds with fallback support
- Responsive design works across all modern browsers

## Files Modified
- `components/landing/Header.tsx` - Added user profile display logic
- `components/auth/Profile.tsx` - Enhanced profile modal with avatar and subscription info
- `App.tsx` - Added sign-out redirect handling

## Testing Status
✅ Development server running without errors
✅ TypeScript compilation successful  
✅ Hot reload working for all changes
✅ No console errors reported
✅ Responsive design verified

The user profile indicator feature is now complete and provides a seamless authentication experience with visual user feedback.
