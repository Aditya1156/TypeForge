### Scenario 3: Security Validation
1. Attempt XSS in form inputs
2. Test rate limiting on repeated requests
3. Verify secure session storage
4. **Expected**: All malicious inputs sanitized
5. **Expected**: Rate limiting blocks excessive requests

### Scenario 4: Accessibility Testing
1. Navigate using only keyboard
2. Test screen reader compatibility
3. Verify ARIA labels
4. **Expected**: Full keyboard navigation
5. **Expected**: Proper semantic structure
