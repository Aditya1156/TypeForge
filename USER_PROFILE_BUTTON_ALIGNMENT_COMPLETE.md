# User Profile Button Alignment - Complete

## Overview
This document details the final visual adjustment made to the user profile button in the AppHeader component for improved aesthetic alignment.

## Changes Made

### AppHeader Component (components/AppHeader.tsx)
- **Reduced container spacing**: Changed `space-x-3` to `space-x-2` in the left side container to create tighter spacing between menu button and user profile
- **Reduced button padding**: Changed `px-3` to `px-2` in the user profile button to make it more compact and shift it slightly left

### Visual Impact
1. **Better Visual Balance**: Tighter spacing creates a more cohesive left-side section
2. **Improved Alignment**: The user profile button now sits in better visual proportion to the menu button
3. **Cleaner Aesthetics**: More compact design improves overall header appearance
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All interactive elements remain fully functional with proper hover states
