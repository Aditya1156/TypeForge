# Guest Trial Feature Implementation

## üéØ **New Feature: 30-Minute Guest Trial**

### **What's New:**
- **Guest Trial Option**: Users can now try TypeForge for 30 minutes without creating an account
- **Persistent Timer**: Trial time is tracked across browser sessions using localStorage
- **Progressive Sign-up Prompts**: Gentle encouragement to sign up during and after trial
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing premium restrictions

## üöÄ **User Experience Flow**

### **1. Initial Landing**
When users visit without an account, they see:
- **Primary CTA**: "Sign Up / Sign In" (recommended)
- **Secondary Option**: "Try for 30 Minutes (No Account Required)"
- **Clear Benefits**: Progress tracking, themes, analytics for accounts

### **2. During Guest Trial**
- **Persistent Timer**: Shows remaining time in top banner
- **Limited Features**: Basic typing practice only
- **Sign-up Prompts**: Small "Sign Up Now" button in timer bar
- **Warning at 5 Minutes**: Timer turns red with urgency

### **3. Trial Expiration**
- **Graceful Block**: Clear message about trial ending
- **Benefits Reminder**: What they get with an account
- **Easy Sign-up**: Direct path to create account

## üõ† **Technical Implementation**

### **New Components:**

#### **1. `useGuestTrial` Hook**
```typescript
// Location: hooks/useGuestTrial.ts
- Manages 30-minute trial state
- Persists trial start time in localStorage

```

#### **2. `TrialTimer` Component**
```typescript
// Location: components/TrialTimer.tsx
- Fixed position timer bar at top of screen
- Shows remaining time with countdown
- Changes to warning state at 5 minutes
- Includes sign-up CTA button
```

#### **3. Enhanced `SessionLimitGuard`**

- Now handles three states:
  1. No user, no trial (show options)
  2. Trial active (show content with timer)
  3. Trial expired (show sign-up prompt)
```

### **Integration Points:**

#### **1. Main App (`App.tsx`)**
