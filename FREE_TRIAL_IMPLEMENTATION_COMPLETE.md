# 30-Minute Free Trial Implementation - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Feature Overview
Successfully implemented a 30-minute free trial system that allows users to start practicing without signing up directly from the landing page "Start Free Practice" button.

## ✅ Implementation Details

### 🚀 **New User Flow**
1. **Landing Page**: User clicks "Start 30-Min Free Trial" button
2. **Auto-Trial**: 30-minute timer starts automatically (no signup required)
3. **Immediate Access**: User gets instant access to typing practice
4. **Timer Display**: Fixed header shows remaining trial time
5. **Expiration Handling**: Automatic redirect to sign-up when trial ends

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

#### **1. Updated Landing Page Flow** (`App.tsx`)
- **New Handler**: `handleStartFreeTrial()` checks user auth status

- **Guest Users**: Automatic 30-minute trial start + app access
- **Success Feedback**: Toast notifications for both flows

#### **2. Enhanced Hero Section** (`components/landing/Hero.tsx`)
- **Updated Button**: "Start 30-Min Free Trial" with clear messaging
- **Single CTA**: Focused user experience with one primary action

#### **3. Trial Management** (`hooks/useGuestTrial.ts`)
- **Persistent Storage**: Trial state saved in localStorage
- **Real-time Updates**: Second-by-second countdown
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Trial data removed on expiration
- **Cross-session**: Trial continues even if user refreshes

#### **4. Expiration Handling** (`App.tsx`)
- **Auto-Detection**: Monitors trial expiration state
- **Graceful Redirect**: Returns user to landing page
- **Sign-up Prompt**: Opens sign-up modal automatically
- **Clear Messaging**: Informative toast about trial end
